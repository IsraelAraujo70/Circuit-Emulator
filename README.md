The Circuit Simulator is a graphical user interface (GUI) application designed to aid in the visualization and simulation of electrical circuits. Developed using the Python tkinter library, this tool allows users to create and analyze circuits with components such as voltage sources, resistors, and nodes.

Key Features:
Component Addition: Users can add voltage sources, resistors, and nodes to the circuit canvas.
Wire Drawing: Connect components with wires using a simple grid-snapping mechanism.
Component Rotation: Rotate components with a right-click for better alignment.
Undo/Redo Functionality: Easily revert or reapply actions using Control+Z and Control+Y shortcuts.
Circuit Calculation: Calculate series and parallel resistances, as well as current flow in the circuit.
Simulation Mode: Check if the circuit is closed and simulate the voltage drops and currents across resistors.
HUD Display: Real-time display of simulation status and component values.
Grid Drawing: Adjustable grid for precise component placement and alignment.
This project aims to provide an educational tool for students and professionals to better understand the behavior of electrical circuits through interactive simulation.
